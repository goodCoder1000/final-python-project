# Overview 🔎🎯
This Python code is a simple **NPC generator** that randomly creates a custom **number of NPCs**, each with a **random name**, **attributes**, a **height**, and **more**.

# Code Explanation ⌨️
When the program starts, the user is asked to enter:
How many **attributes** each NPC should have (between **1 and 5**).
```py
number_of_attributes = int(input("How many attributes do you want per NPC (1-5): "))
```
It automatically uses 10 NPCs.

If you enter a value outside of the range that I specified, it tells you to restart.
```py
if number_of_attributes <= 5 and number_of_attributes >= 1:
    x = 1 # buffer (this means everything is good (Basically just does nothing))
else:
    print("BAD INPUT! RESTART!")
    exit() # kills project
```
## The Complicated Code Explanation 💻⌨️
The script then randomly selects from two lists: one containing names and another containing attributes. Each NPC is also given a random height between **4.0 and 7.0 feet**, which is my float, a random boolean **“Is tuff?”**, which is obviously my boolean, which is value that determines their toughness (lol).
```py
height = random.randint(40, 70) / 10
tuff = random.randint(0,2)
```
Inside a loop running **10 times** (which is the number of NPCs being created), it prints the attributes. The number of attributes depends on how many you want (this is prompted at the start of the project). After this, it ***prints*** the **height** and indicates whether they are tough or not.
```py
print("Height: " + str(height) + "'") # height print
    print("Is tuff?: " + str(bool(tuff))) # tuff print
```
Earlier, it only randomized the variable; it didn't print.


# Libraries 📚 
This program uses the random library for **randomness**.
```py
import random
```
It also uses the time library just to make everything **cleaner**!
```py
import time
```
