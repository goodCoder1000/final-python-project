# Overview
This Python code is a simple **NPC generator** that randomly creates a custom **number of NPCs**, each with a **random name**, **attributes**, a **height**, and **more**.

# Code Explanation
When the program starts, the user is asked to enter:
How many **attributes** each NPC should have (between **1 and 5**).
It automatically uses 10 NPCs.

If you enter a value outside of the range that I specified, it tells you to restart.

The script then randomly selects from two lists: one containing names and another containing attributes. Each NPC is also given a random height between **4.0 and 7.0 feet** and a random boolean **“Is tuff?”** value that determines their toughness (lol).

# Libraries
This program uses the random library for **randomness**. It also uses the time library just to make everything **cleaner**!
