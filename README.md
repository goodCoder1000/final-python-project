This Python code is a simple NPC generator that randomly creates a custom amount of NPCs, each with a random name, attributes, and a height.

When the program starts, the user is asked to enter:
How many NPCs to generate (between 1 and 10).
How many attributes each NPC should have (between 1 and 5).

If you enter a value outside of the range that I specified, it tells you to restart.

The script then randomly selects from two lists: one containing names, and another containing attributes. Each NPC is also given a random height between 4.0 and 7.0 feet and a random Boolean “Is tuff?” value that determines their toughness (lol).

This program uses the random library for randomness.
